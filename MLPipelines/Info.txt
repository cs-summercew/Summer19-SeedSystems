Mixed Categorical and numeric features:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40434485/machine-learning-algorithm-for-mixed-categorical-and-numeric-features


What if you have only categorical features?
Refer to Classification-Pipeline.py

What if you have only numeric(continuous) features?
Refer to Regression-Pipeline.py

What if you have a mix of the two kinds of features?
Refer to Regression-Pipeline.py
Options:
1- Don't use one type of feature (my approach in Regression-Pipeline.py)
2- Put ranges of your numeric(continuous) into bins
3- Perform Normalization: for each feature, subtract the mean of the feature and then divide by the standard deviation of the feature. Use StandardScaler in Scikit-learn.
