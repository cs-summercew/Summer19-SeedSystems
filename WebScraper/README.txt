Running EsotericScraper.py should create the file Scraped_Files containing the html files for input links from https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list

Files_To_Parse should be the same as Scraped_Files after it is created by EsotericScraper.py. 
Files_To_Parse is used by EsotericParser.py to output EsoData.csv which summarizes some of the information in each file.
