# Tips for Using our Repo
Please read the instructions we have added as comments in each .py file to ensure that you have the proper libriaries installed, and for helpful information. Important Comments in our code will be marked by a NOTE:, TODO:, or BUG:  If you are using anaconda, you should have *most* of the libraries you will need to use our seed-systems. Also pay attention to the readme.md files in each folder. They should explain what each program does for the most part.

# Installation
We ran our code using Anaconda/Python 3. We have included the installation instructions from this year's CS121 course as Installation.txt and it may be helpful in installing everything you need to run our seed systems.

## TODO:
selTest-Firefox.py seems broken
Finish installation instructions
Fix documentations, especially the OpenCV folder
Fix .gitignore so that it ignores file output / get rid of file outputs from the directory
