# Tips for Using our Repo
Please read the instructions we have added as comments in each .py file to ensure that you have the proper libriaries installed, and for helpful information. Important Comments in our code will be marked by a NOTE:, TODO:, or BUG:  
If you are using anaconda, you should have *most* of the libraries you will need to use our seed-systems. Also pay attention to the readme.md files in each folder. They should explain what each program does for the most part.

## Installation
We ran our code using Anaconda/Python 3. We have included the installation instructions from this year's CS121 course as Installation.md which may be helpful in installing what you need to run our seed systems.

## Acknowledgments
This repo was created by the CS4All Clinic Development Team in the Summer of 2019: Chris Butler, Tim Chen, Justin Gadalla, Ciante Jones, and Dylan McGarvey

### TODO:
ExampleFlaskApp- Image Inverter seems broken, code is weird too. Should probably add Tim's Example if possible.
MLPipelines- Needs a readme documentation / mention Fall CS121 code framework
StatsModels Systems- readme doc
WebScrapers- readme doc, and fix broken things (selTest-Firefox.py)
OpenCV- fix readme docs, and organization
Fix documentations, especially the OpenCV folder
Fix .gitignore so that it ignores file output / get rid of file outputs from the directory
