We ran our code using Anaconda/Python 3.

# Installation
After anaconda, install selenium and openCV

## TODO:
selTest-Firefox.py seems broken
Finish installation instructions
Fix documentations, especially the OpenCV folder
Fix .gitignore so that it ignores file output / get rid of file outputs from the directory
